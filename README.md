# PacmanWeb
The platform on which we will be training our PacmanAI.
By having the game run on a nodejs server we can have multiple computers run the AI + game independently from each other, this will make testing easier.

# PacmanAI
The machine that will ultimately learn how to play Pacman and hopefully give us some clues as to how we can streamline the learning process of said AI.
